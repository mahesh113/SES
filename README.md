# Simple Exchagne Service

Added ConversionService which calls the exchangerate-api to get the rates value for a given currentcy.

Currently added only a few currencies to be supported (AUD, USD, ARS, CAD, CHF, CLP, EUR, GBP), but they can be easily extended.

Not adding the unit tests now. I generally write unit tests in xUnit framework. HttpClient mocking is not very tough, I've done before. But its too late to do all lookup work and add the tests. So I leave for our discussions later.

Api endpoint added as per specifications. 

Hope code is not clumsy.

Thanks.
